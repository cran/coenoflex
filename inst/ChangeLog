coenoflex_2.2-0

1) converted a number of REAL*4 to REAL*8 constants to eliminate warnings 
from the -pedantic switch of gfortran.

coenoflex_2.1-0

1) coenoflex underwent a fairly significant renovation to deal with problems
parsing strings in FORTRAN.  Specifically, the autpar() function which parses
the autecology gradient function was re-written entirely in R to avoid passing
any strings to FORTRAN.  This allowed eliminating the AUTPAR, TOLOWER, and
COLLAP subroutines from the FORTRAN code.

2) the plot function was re-written to allow single gradient plots

coenoflex 2.0-1

1) coenoflex was converted to a NAMESPACE implementation

2) an internal FORTRAN write statment was eliminated
and replaced with a string substitution

3) the documentation was tidied up slightly
